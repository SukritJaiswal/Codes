# Codes
All Codes written for the projects:

Most of the C language codes here were written mostly by my supervisor, Prof. Debarati Chatterjee, which she gave to me for review and possible corrections (which I did occasionally) as I had less idea for the physics used in the codes at that time. All Python and Fortran (under Assignment folders) codes are written by me.
